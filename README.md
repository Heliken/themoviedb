## To Do:

    - [x] trending, popular and upcoming moves or tv-series
    - [x] live search
- [ ] 2. Movie/tv-series details page
- [ ] 3. Person details page
---
### Nice to have
- [x] Live search sholud search movies, tv-series and people simultaneously.
- [ ] Movie list page with sorting and filtering.
- [ ] Movies by genre page - list of movies + pagination + sorting
- [ ] subpage of a movie details page with a list of cast and crew members
---
### Extra hard level
- [ ] authentification feature similar to oAuth
- [ ] Favourites feature that allows users to add or remove movies form their favourites list. If user has at least 1 movie - list should be shown on mainpage. Users sholud be able to add movie to list from the movie details page.
